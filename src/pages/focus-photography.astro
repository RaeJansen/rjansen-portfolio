        <p class="pb-3">The Focus Photography Club project was a college assignment set out to reimagine the clubs digital membership experience — creating a modern, intuitive platform that invites photographers of all levels to join, connect, and grow. The goal was to transform a confusing system across various applications into a user-friendly digital process that reflected the club’s welcoming and creative spirit.</p>

                <p class="pb-2">The club’s original membership form was unclear. Information about fees, benefits, and portfolio submissions was scattered across multiple platforms the club used to host itself, discouraging potential members from applying. I wanted to simplify this process and build trust from the first click — especially for beginners who might feel intimidated by professional portfolio requirements</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold py-3">Key questions driving the design sprint included:</h4>

                            <p class="pb-2">My team of four conducted a design sprint to map the user journey, identify pain points, and establish clear project goals. From this, we defined the long-term mission:</p>

                            <p>We explored multiple interface concepts emphasizing simplicity and visual hierarchy — short forms, large call-to-action buttons, and transparent pricing. The best ideas were distilled into a storyboard that guided prototype development.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Feedback led to simplifying language, adding tooltips to explain the darkroom benefit, and re-evaluating optional fields to better balance inclusivity and professional appeal.</p>

                        <p>I developed a cohesive style guide built around the concept of focus.</p>

                        <p class="pb-3">The final prototype scored 16 / 18 in evaluation, praised for intuitive usability, strong hierarchy, and empathy-driven design choices. My instructor highlighted the prototype’s clarity and how effectively it addressed user concerns, recommending more detailed input exploration for future iterations.</p>
                        <p>I then extended the work into a desktop landing page composition, refining responsive layouts and grid systems for real-world application. Feedback emphasized my strong understanding of design principles (repetition, alignment, proximity) and attention to accessibility — notes included more contrast for clarity and modifying the calendar on mobile, which I implemented to further improve my skills.</p>
