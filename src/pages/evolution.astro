        <p class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.08em] text-base-content/60">Client Project</p>
        <p class="pb-3">Evolution First Aid & CPR Training is an ongoing Capstone project developed in collaboration with a real Edmonton-based business specializing in certified emergency response instruction.</p>
        <p>My role has centered on user experience design, brand modernization, and visual system development — with the next stage focused on implementing the website through a custom WordPress environment.</p>
        <p>The project’s mission is to transform Evolution’s existing static site into a modern, credible, and conversion-focused platform that simplifies course registration, clearly presents training options, and reflects the trustworthiness expected from professional first-aid educators.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold py-3">The Challenge</h3>
                <p class="pb-2">The client’s existing digital presence was outdated and confusing, lacking a clear booking process and visual cohesion.</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold py-3">Key challenges included:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pb-3">
                    <li class="list-item ml-5">Organizing information architecture in a way that makes courses easy to fine.</li>
                    <li class="list-item ml-5">Updating the look of the website to match the business' professionalism and authority.</li>
                    <li class="list-item ml-5">Adding registration so users can be reminded of their upcoming courses and expiring certificates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our goal was to design a cohesive digital ecosystem that inspires trust and reduces barriers for new learners — from individuals booking CPR certification to healthcare professionals seeking advanced training.</p>

                            <p class="pb-2">Our team of three began with collaborative sprint sessions to identify core user types:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc pb-3">
                                <li class="list-item ml-5">General public seeking first-aid certification.</li>
                                <li class="list-item ml-5">Healthcare professionals needing mandated recertification.</li>
                                <li class="list-item ml-5">Corporate or group clients scheduling on-site sessions.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>From there, we structured the site architecture to clearly separate these audiences and mapped course flows that guide users seamlessly from discovery to booking.</p>

                                <p class="pb-2">To bring the brand up to modern standards, I built a complete style guide and design language grounded in clarity and trust:</p>

                                    <li class="list-item ml-5"><span class="font-bold">Colors: </span>Professional white and gray foundation, accented with teal for stability and emergency red for calls to action.</li>
                                    <li class="list-item ml-5"><span class="font-bold">Typography: </span>The Montserrat typeface for its approachable yet authoritative character.</li>

                                    <li class="list-item ml-5"><span class="font-bold">Visual Tone: </span>Rounded corners (3px) and large, accessible buttons create a balance between clinical professionalism and modern friendliness.</li>

                            <p class="pb-3">Using these foundations, We created both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes in Figma, focusing on consistent spacing, alignment, and component logic for future development. The resulting prototype highlights a streamlined course catalog, smooth booking flow, and an “About” section that introduces the founder and instructors in a human, trustworthy way. Each page has been designed with responsive scaling in mind, ensuring the experience remains clear and readable across all devices.</p>

  <h3  class="text-2xl font-bold py-3">Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    This capstone has pushed me to merge visual design systems with technical planning — bridging the gap between aesthetics, usability, and development practicality.
    It’s taught me how to communicate with real clients, present work iteratively, and make design decisions grounded in both brand identity and user needs.
    As the site moves into its build phase, my focus is on translating this cohesive visual vision into a responsive, production-ready platform.
