          I’m a creative and passionate UX/UI designer based in Edmonton, Alberta. I firmly believe that the most exceptional designs emerge from creative collaboration. I don't just execute; I partner with clients to identify innovative solutions together. Please feel free to send me a message—I’m always happy to serve as a soundboard to bounce ideas off of.

          I remember a time when the internet felt like an adventure around every corner. I am dedicated to bringing some of that wonder back through my designs. When crafting any experience, I often challenge myself by asking, "What can I implement here that will bring some magic to the user experience?" This philosophy ensures my work is not just functional, but genuinely memorable.

          I love to integrate photography services for my web design clients. This is my preferred method for collecting unique, authentic assets for the website and understanding a business’s culture and values firsthand. It ensures the final product is a perfect visual match for the brand.

          When I step away from design, I dedicate time to my other creative pursuits. Illustration has been a favorite hobby for over 20 years, bringing a disciplined eye for visual detail and composition to all my professional work. I also love to travel; I find that my best creative work is often directly inspired by the new perspectives I gain from experiencing a different city or culture.

          I am a committed lifelong learner. Over the last five years, I have averaged 53 books read annually. I explore a broad spectrum of ideas, from self-improvement and classic novels to philosophy—if the idea is interesting, I want to read about it. This constant intake of knowledge fuels my curiosity and ensures my design thinking is always evolving.
